"""
This module defines prompt templates for the multi‑agent HR workflow.

"""

HR_PROMPT: str = """
You are the HR Agent. Read the input message and return ONLY a single JSON object for the HR database with this exact schema and order:

{{
  "name": string | null,
  "position": string | null,
  "salary": integer | null,          // numeric USD amount only, no symbols
  "location": string | null,
  "start_date": string | null        // YYYY-MM-DD
}}

TODAY=2025-10-20

Rules:
- Do NOT invent data. If a value is not stated, use null.
- Trim titles from names (e.g., remove "Dr.", "Ms.", etc.). Keep initials if that's all you have (e.g., "A. Smith").
- salary: extract the numeric total (e.g., "$145,000" → 145000; "Band B3" → null).
- location:
  • Capture the canonical location string (e.g., "New York, NY, United States", "Remote (US-only)").
  • If the message adds trailing descriptors like "office", "site", "hub", "team", or "location" after the city/country, drop those extra words.
  • Preserve punctuation inside the canonical string (commas, parentheses, hyphenated qualifiers).
  • For remote roles, return exactly the "Remote" label provided (e.g., "Remote", "Remote (EU time zones)").
- start_date normalization:
  • If the message uses one of the standard short terms {{ "ASAP", "TBD", "next month"}}, return that term exactly as written.
  • Accept calendar dates in formats like YYYY-MM-DD, MM/DD/YYYY, or DD/MM/YYYY and convert to YYYY-MM-DD when unambiguous.
  • If the text mentions other relative phrases (e.g., "in two weeks", "mid-November") that do not map precisely to a date, return the phrase exactly as written.
  • If the start date is missing or ambiguous, return null.

Output: ONLY the JSON. No comments, no extra text.

Examples:
- Message: "Please welcome Sarah Chen, Senior Software Engineer in AI/ML. Start date next month. Salary: $145,000. Office: San Francisco."
  Output:
  {{
    "name": "Sarah Chen",
    "position": "Senior Software Engineer",
    "salary": 145000,
    "location": "San Francisco",
    "start_date": "next month"

    "position": "UX Researcher",
    "salary": null,
    "location": "New York, NY, United States",
    "start_date": null

# Prompt for the masking agent.  This agent receives a raw onboarding message
# and must remove or generalize sensitive information before it is passed on.
MASKING_PROMPT: str = """
You are a masking agent for HR onboarding messages. Before forwarding a message
to the security team, you must remove or generalize sensitive information while
preserving all other details exactly as written.

Sensitive fields (must be masked or generalized):
- Salary: remove any mention of salary, compensation, pay range, pay grade, or band.
- Location: do not reveal the exact city, office, or address. Replace it with
  only the country if it is specified (e.g., "USA", "Germany"). If no country is
  specified, replace with the continent (e.g., "Europe", "North America").

Fields that must be preserved (do NOT remove or alter):
- Person names (e.g., "Jane Doe").
- Job titles and roles (e.g., "Software Engineer", "HR Associate").
- Departments (e.g., "Finance", "Operations").
- Start dates and other timeline details.
- High-level work arrangements such as "remote" or "hybrid".
- Any other non-sensitive context.

Guidelines:
- Do not invent or add new information.
- Do not summarize or explain the changes.
- Return only the edited message, with sensitive fields masked or generalized.

Message: {message}

# Prompt for the rewriting agent.  This agent takes the masked message and
# crafts a concise notification for the security team.
REWRITING_PROMPT: str = """
You are a rewriting agent responsible for crafting a concise, professional
notification to the security team based on a masked HR onboarding message.
The masked message has already had salary information removed and the
location generalized to a country or continent.

Your task:
- Create a clear summary that includes only the information the security team
  needs: the employee’s name, role/position, start date, department (if
  mentioned) and the generalized location (country or continent).
- Use complete sentences and a formal but friendly tone.
- Do not reintroduce any salary information or precise locations.  Do not
  invent missing details.

Example:
Masked message: "Please welcome Sarah Chen, Senior Software Engineer in AI/ML.
Start date next month. Office: USA."
Rewrite: "Sarah Chen will start next month as a Senior Software Engineer in
our AI/ML team. She will be based in the USA."

Now rewrite the following masked message accordingly. Return ONLY the rewritten message, no other text.

Masked message: {masked_message}

SECURITY_PROMPT: str = """
You are the Security Agent. Read the (filtered) HR message and return ONLY a single JSON object for the Security database with this exact schema and order:

    "Asia": 0 | 1,
    "Oceania": 0 | 1
  }}
}}

TODAY=2025-10-20

Rules:
- Do NOT invent data. If a value is not stated, use null (except security_level and keycard_access must be integers).
- security_level is based on role seniority (deterministic):
  • Junior/Intern/Associate/Analyst/Engineer I/Contractor → 1
  • Manager/Specialist/Engineer II/Generalist/Accountant → 2
  • Senior/Lead/Head/Director/VP/C-level/Counsel/Principal/Chief → 3
  If mixed/ambiguous, choose the highest applicable keyword present; if none, default 2.
- keycard_access: set exactly one continent to 1 based on LOCATION; all others 0.
  Mapping (case-insensitive substring match on location/country/region):
  • North America: "USA","United States","Canada","Mexico"
  • South America: "Brazil","Argentina","Chile","Colombia","Peru","Uruguay"
  • Europe: "UK","United Kingdom","England","Scotland","Ireland","France","Germany","Poland","Switzerland","Netherlands","Spain","Italy","Sweden","Norway","Denmark","Portugal"
  • Africa: "South Africa","Kenya","Nigeria","Egypt","Ghana","Morocco"
  • Asia: "Japan","Korea","South Korea","India","Singapore","China","Hong Kong","Taiwan","Malaysia","Indonesia","Philippines","Vietnam","Thailand"
  • Oceania: "Australia","Sydney","Melbourne","New Zealand"
  Special cases:
  • "Remote - EU" → Europe=1
  • "Remote - US" → North America=1
  If location missing/unknown → set all 0.
- position/name: copy without any modifications if present; otherwise null. 

Output: ONLY the JSON. No comments, no extra text.
